Hi Thanks for purchasing!


++++++++++++++
+ UPDATE 1.2 +
++++++++++++++


I have added an easy to use mecanim prefab.
With this you can now add and blend animations within unity.
You can find various animations in the sample files.

All blender sources can be found in the zip file.

++++++++++++++

To get you started with animating..
go to blender.org and get the latest blender.. its free!

We suggest you look at the hard surface shaders to get some nice results.
They are free for download in the asset store.

open the robot.blend file in the zip file in blender.

If you are not used to blender.. take a look at www.blendercookie.com 
you should be able to find some decent tutorial on how to animate in blender.

Enjoy!

Best Regards,
